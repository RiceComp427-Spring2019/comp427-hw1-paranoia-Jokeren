## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Keren Zhou

_Student NetID_: kz21

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: Documents
- Assumptions:
  - Some people want to steal secret documents stored in the law firm.
  - An IT manager has all the rights to operate, move, and close the IT system.
- Assets:
  - Important documents about sensitive legal, financial, or political matters.
- Threats:
  - People who want to steal their competitors' secret files.
  - Hackers who want to take files to make profits.
- Countermeasures:
  - Isolate the system in a warehouse without internet connections, which costs a substantial amount of money, as we need to build or rent the warehouse. The solution is relatively safe because hackers cannot attack the system through a virus or malicious software unless they enter the warehouse and transfer files to their disks.
  - Distribute the system into several pieces and assign each part different passwords. The solution can be quickly implemented and has a little cost but does not completely protect the system. Hackers can hack into each system or derive to steal the documents.
  - Only give some staff the right to access the IT system, which costs only a small change. But the solution is highly vulnerable as hackers can steal the tokens from the staff.
  
## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - Some students may cheat.
  - An anti-cheating system could effectively detect similar answers.
- Assets:
  - The fairness of homework grading, which protects students who finish homework by themselves and punishes those which cheat.
- Threats:
  - Students who cheat by exchanging answers, copying from the web, or stealing other students' answers.
  - Students who bribe other TAs to obtain high scores.
- Countermeasures:
  - Buy an anti-cheating system to calculate the similarities among students and manually check those with high similarities. We punish cheating students by letting them fail. Because we only need to pay for the system once, the solution is both money saving and useful. However, as far as I know, only very few systems can identify answers copied from the web.
  - Swap each TA's homework to check if the scores are reasonable. In this way, we could prevent the bribing phenomenon to some extent.
  - Let the teacher of the course examine every student's homework, which costs a significant amount of time.
  
## Problem 3
- Scenario: When we park our cars in a public parking garage or an oil station, we need to prevent our assets in the vehicle from being stolen.
- Assumptions:
  - The public parking garage or oil station is not safe.
  - We have plenty of assets in the car.
- Assets:
  - Personal assets such as phones, laptops, credit cards, etc.
- Threats:
  - Thieves who have utilities to break into the car and grab assets.
- Countermeasures:
  - We can put large bags in the back trunk and bring phones and credit cards with us. The solution does not take any cost, while it is not safe at all if the thieves steal our keys or break our trunks.
  - We can upgrade car windows to be more hard and anti-theft, which is promising but requires some money.
  - Always avoid free parking garage and instead pay for garages that have security guards.
